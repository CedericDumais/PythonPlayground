## 0. PREAMBLE

This repository, hereby known as “PythonPlayground”,  
is a chaotic collection of notes, experiments, half-baked ideas, 
questionable functions, and the occasional moment of brilliance. 
(usually not committed).

WHEREAS the Maintainer woke up and chose chaos; and  
WHEREAS this repository is hereinafter and forevermore referred to as 
"The Code" or "That Thing I Wrote Once";

By viewing, forking, cloning, copying, or spiritually absorbing this code, 
you agree to the following Terms of Mild Regret:


## 1. PERMISSION TO POKE THE CODE

1.1. You are allowed to use, copy, modify, merge, run, refactor, rename badly,
     and generally mess around with the contents of this repository.

1.2. You may fork it, star it, unstar it, forget about it, 
     rediscover it years later and wonder what Past You was thinking, 
     then `git blame` yourself anyway.

1.3. You may use pieces of it in your own projects, 
     homework, memes, or other dubious endeavors.

1.4. No formal permission slip is required. 
     A respectful nod at the README is sufficient.

1.5. You may open issues such as "does not work" or "why", 
     but there is no guarantee of a fix, a response, 
     or even that the maintainer read past the title.

---

## 2. ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEES (ESPECIALLY ABOUT MATH)

2.1. The code and notes in this repository come with zero guarantees of 
     correctness, elegance, efficiency, or sanity.

2.2. You must not rely on anything in here to:
- Pass an exam, certification, trial by combat, 
  boss fight, or NPC dialogue check
- Impress a senior engineer, guild master, 
  or that one friend who mods everything
- Keep a production server, Minecraft world, IoT air fryer, Tamagotchi, 
  or any other allegedly “mission-critical” entity running
- “Definitely” solve your math problems, life problems, 
  or time-travel paradoxes
- Convince your teacher, professor, advisor, manager, rubber duck, 
  or sentient whiteboard that you fully know what you're doing
- Prove a theorem, tame a differential equation, invert a cursed matrix, 
  or banish the ancient evil sealed inside your statistics homework
- Convince any human, AI, or rubber duck that you truly understand calculus, 
  linear algebra, tensor calculus, category theory, quantum probability, 
  or whatever academic eldritch horror you have recently summoned
- Achieve compliance with ISO-whatever, satisfy auditors, lawyers, 
  grant committees, grant committee's cats, or 
  any deity (ancient, modern, hypothetical, or implemented as a microservice)
- Maintain the stability of the stock market, the space-time continuum, 
  your GPA, your social life, or any other system known to 
  spontaneously explode under observation
- Ensure your numerical methods converge, your gradients descend, 
  or your floating-point errors stay in the realm of “fun fact” 
  rather than “postmortem root cause”

2.3. If this code accidentally helps you understand something, 
     that is a happy accident, not a contractual obligation.  
     No refunds will be issued for sudden clarity.

> [!NOTE]  
> By using this code you agree not to show it to a real mathematician, 
> and if a real mathematician sees this, you agree to deny knowing the author.

## 3. FEELINGS CLAUSE

3.1. You are free (and gently encouraged) to experience any 
     and all of the following feelings while using this repository:
- Amusement
- Confusion
- Mild enlightenment ("wait… I kind of get this?") 
- Existential dread, preferably in small, manageable doses
- The creeping suspicion that the computer is laughing at you
- A sudden urge to rewrite everything from scratch for no good reason
- The weirdly satisfying joy when the code finally runs, 
  followed by looking around to tell someone, realizing everyone left hours ago, 
  and high-fiving your own screen instead.

3.2. You may also feel free to feel freeing feelings about your coding journey. 
     Imposter syndrome is explicitly not licensed 
     and should be uninstalled where possible.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You are not allowed to use `git blame` for emotional damage calculations.

## 4. CHAOS & STYLE DISCLAIMER

4.1. File structure, naming conventions, and organization may be:
- In progress
- Experimental
- Non-existent
- Existing only in the maintainer's head and nowhere on disk
- Actively rearranging themselves between `git pull`s

4.2. Any resemblance between this repository and a clean, well-structured, 
     production-ready codebase is purely coincidental and mildly suspicious.

4.3. Comments may be:
- Outdated
- Wrong
- Sarcastic
- Written at 4 a.m. and left unfixed on purpose
- In passive aggressive future tense ("TODO: someone else fix this")

4.4. Some functions may return `None` not just in Python, but spiritually.

4.5. Code style may include:
- `snake_case`, `camelCase`, `PascalCase`, and `wHAt_is_tHIs_eVEn`
- Indentation that technically works but feels philosophically incorrect
- A PEP 8 compliance level best described as "aspirational fan fiction"

---

## 5. LIABILITY (THERE IS NONE)

To the maximum extent allowed by whatever laws apply to you:

5.1. The maintainer(s) of this repository are not responsible for:
- Crashed programs
- Crashed servers
- Crashed computers
- Crashed sleep schedules
- Lost marks, lost time, or lost sanity
- Any feelings experienced while reading `git blame`

5.2. You use this code at your own risk.
     If things break, you are in charge of debugging both the code 
     and your life choices.  
     Stack Overflow is not obligated to help you, but it probably will.

---

## 6. ATTRIBUTION & FORKING

6.1. You do not have to attribute this repository if you copy bits of code.  
     However, if you feel the ancient pull of courtesy, you may perform the
     Sacred Comment Ritual, for example:
```py
# Borrowed from PythonPlayground
# If it works, I take the credit.
# If it breaks, I was never here.
```
This is not legally required, but it pleases the debugging spirits and 
slightly reduces the chance of mysterious segfaults in unrelated languages.

6.2. If you fork the repository:
- You are welcome to add your own chaos
- You may rename your fork to something silly, dramatic or 
  completely unpronounceable
- You remain responsible for whatever madness you add on top, 
  including but not limited to:
  - Recursive fractal nonsense
  - Self-replicating spaghetti code
  - Emergent bug ecosystems
  - Fork-bomb energy
  - Nested uncertainty
  - Code comments that start sounding like cries for help
- You accept that your fork may one day be forked, and that you may become 
  "the weird ancestor repo" in someone else's commit history

6.3. If your fork becomes more organized, popular, or understandable 
than the original:
- The original maintainer reserves the right to sit quietly in the corner, 
  whisper "nice," and pretend that was the plan all along
- You are encouraged, but not required, to add exactly one comment acknowledging
  this turn of events, such as:
  ```py
  # This descended from PythonPlayground.
  # It escaped containment, and now we live like this.
  ```

6.4. If someone blames this repository for anything your fork does, you agree to
     gently redirect them to your fork and say, "they grew up so fast."

## 7. NO WARRANTY, SERIOUSLY

7.1. The repository is provided “AS IS”, “AS SEEN AT 3 A.M.”, and
     “AS MY BRAIN UNDERSTOOD IT AT THE TIME”, without warranty of any kind,
     express, implied, or hallucinated after too much coffee.

7.2. If you want a serious, legally reviewed software license,
     you should also include a real one (MIT, Apache-2.0, etc.)
     in addition to this nonsense.

---

## 8. FINAL BOSS CLAUSE

If any part of this license conflicts with actual law or 
a real license you decide to add later, the real law and the real license win.  
You have encountered: **Actual Legally Binding Stuff**, 
which is a higher-level boss.

When that happens, this document is immediately downgraded to its true form:
- A silly badge of honor for your Python learning journey  
- Flavor text for your repository  
- A cryptic artifact for future archaeologists of your commit history  
- Evidence that at some point you looked at standard licenses and said, 
  "Yes, but what if it was funny..."

---

## 9. CONTRIBUTION RITUAL

9.1. Pull requests might be welcome, especially if they:
- Reduce the number of bugs, or at least 
  rearrange them into a more aesthetic pattern
- Turn at least one `TODO` into a `MAYBE LATER`
- Add tests that occasionally pass on your machine 
  for reasons no one fully understands
- Add examples or tests that do not require sacrificing a weekend

9.2. By submitting a pull request, you certify that you either:
- wrote the code,
- copied it from somewhere else that also didn't know what it was doing, or
- were, to the best of your knowledge, at least 30% awake while doing so

9.3. The maintainer reserves the right to:
- Merge instantly with a commit message like "stuff"
- Leave it open just long enough for you to forget what you did
- Comment only “nice” or “interesting” and vanish into the ether
- Close it with “works on my machine” without specifying which machine

---

## 10. JURISDICTION & STACK OVERFLOW

10.1. This license is governed by:
- The laws of your jurisdiction, 
- The unofficial rules of Stack Overflow, Reddit, 
  and whoever reviews your code while squinting at it,
- The ancient tradition of "have you tried turning it off and on again"

10.2. In the event of a dispute, the preferred resolution order is:
   1. Re-running the exact same command and quietly hoping for a different result
   2. Blaming the dependencies, the environment, or quantum fluctuations 
   3. Asking a friend, coworker, or unsuspecting bystander 
   4. Accepting that maybe this was not the best approach
   5. Taking a walk and questioning your life choices
   6. Commenting the code and pretending it was intentional all along
   7. Renaming the file to `final_final_for_real_this_time.py` and moving on
